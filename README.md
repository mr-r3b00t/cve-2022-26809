Guidance
â€¢	Ideally patch affected Windows Servers and Clients

Mitigation
â€¢	Ensure RPC is not exposed to the internet
â€¢	Restrict ingress network services that allow RPC (this could cause loss of availability)
â€¢	Restrict service based on role
â€¢	Restrict ingress services to specific segments/scopes e.g., use Windows Firewall to allow PAWS to connect via RPC for remote admin activities. Clearly consideration should be made for roles such as:
o	Domain Controllers
o	File & Print Servers
o	Other services relying on RPC to operate
â€¢	Consider preparing a break glass GPO with restrictive host-based firewall rules allowing PAWS access)

Unknowns

â€¢	Does this affect RPC over HTTP?
